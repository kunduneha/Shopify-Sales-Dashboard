# Shopify-Sales-Dashboard
This Power BI project turns Shopify sales data into meaningful business insights. This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across products, payment methods, and regions. It helps businesses understand what’s selling, who’s buying, and where growth opportunities lie. The report is designed for e-commerce teams, retail analysts, and marketing professionals who want to make data-driven decisions using real-time visuals.

Built with clean data modelling and interactive visuals, it brings clarity to complex sales patterns by highlighting key metrics like total revenue (₹438K), profit (₹37K), and average order value (₹121K). From identifying high-value customers to analysing category trends, every visual tells a story that supports smarter, data-driven decisions.

This project reflects my approach to analytical storytelling — transforming raw data into actionable insights through design, precision, and purpose.
